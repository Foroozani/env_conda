**How to set up a virtual environments using conda for the Anaconda Python distribution**

A virtual environment is a named, isolated, working copy of Python that that maintains its own files, directories, and paths so that you can work with specific versions of libraries or `Python` itself without affecting other Python projects. Virtual environmets make it easy to cleanly separate different projects and avoid problems with different dependencies and version requiremetns across components. The `conda` command is the preferred interface for managing intstallations and virtual environments with the *Anaconda* Python distribution
